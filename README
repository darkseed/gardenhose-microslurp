simple set of scripts for slurping twitter gardenhose
and uploading to s3 daily

restarts curl from gardenhose hourly to ensure dropped
connections are reestablished from time to time

requires a s3 bucket to be created beforehand, should
really roll into the script

1. start a micro instance and ssh on

$ yum install git
$ git clone git://github.com/matpalm/gardenhose-microslurp.git
$ cp gardenhose-microslurp/* .
$ ./bootstrap.sh

sets some env vars for twitter uid, s3 creds

just extracted the uids/pwds into env vars and
haven't cloned this from scratch onto a new instance
yet (ie might have some, errr, "nuances")
