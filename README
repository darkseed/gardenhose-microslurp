simple set of scripts for slurping twitter gardenhose and uploading to s3 daily

restarts curl from gardenhose hourly to ensure dropped connections are reestablished from time to time

requires a s3 bucket to be created beforehand (should really roll into the script)

start a micro instance and ssh on and run...
$ yum install git
$ git clone git://github.com/matpalm/gardenhose-microslurp.git
$ cp gardenhose-microslurp/* .
$ ./bootstrap.sh

bootstrap sets some env vars (in ~/env_vars) for twitter uid, 
s3 creds and sets up some cron jobs
